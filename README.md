### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Anna, a passionate software developer with a love for creating meaningful and impactful projects. Here's a little about what I'm up to:


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a task manager application with password protection.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js to enhance my frontend development skills.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that make a positive difference in people's lives, specifically in EdTech.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to software development, web development, AI training, NLP or EdTech.
- ğŸ“« You can reach me via email at anna@example.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/annadunphy1)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing video games in my free time but nothing makes me as happy as a little bit of DIY.
